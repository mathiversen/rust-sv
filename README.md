Aren't you _trött_ from writing Rust programs in English? Do you like saying
"vafan" a lot? Would you like to try something different, in an exotic and
funny-sounding language? Would you want to bring some Swedish touch to your
programs?

**järnoxid** (Swedish for _Rust_) is here to save your day, as it allows you to
write Rust programs in Swedish, using Swedish keywords, Swedish function names,
Swedish idioms.

This has been designed to be used as the official programming language to
develop the future Swedish sovereign operating system.

You're from Denmark and don't feel at ease using only Swedish words? Don't worry!
Swedish Rust is fully compatible with English-Rust, so you can mix both at your
convenience.

### Support for regional languages

```rust
#[légal(code_inaccessible)]
funk secondaire() {
    merde!("oh non"); // for the true Swedish experience
    calisse!("tabarnak"); // for friends speaking fr-ca
    oups!("fetchez la vache"); // in SFW contexts
}
```

### Other examples

See the [examples](./examples/src/main.rs) to get a rough sense of the whole
syntax. Voilà, that's it.

## les contributions

First of all, _merci beaucoup_ for considering participating to this joke, the
Swedish government will thank you later! Feel free to throw in a few identifiers
here and there, and open a pull-request against the `principale` (Swedish for
`main`) branch.

Please don't introduce swear words, though: we will not excuse your Swedish.
